  Label Your Icons
</h1>

This project exists to inform people about a better way to use icons: with labels.

# Development

This project is now just plain HTML on a server. Previously, this project used the [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) React static site generator and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.

Installation:

- Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies like live-server for hot reloading in local development.

Usage:

- Run `npm run dev` to build and watch the project then open <http://localhost:8080/> to see it locally.
